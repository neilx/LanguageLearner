I am appending my current cumulative Danish vocabulary CSV file. 
It uses the following columns and order: W2,W1,L1,L2,StudyDay,Note,IPA
- W2 = Danish word
- W1 = English word
- L1 = English sentence
- L2 = Danish sentence
- StudyDay = integer
- Note = idiomatic or grammatical notes
- IPA = IPA for Danish word
⚠️ Important Instructions:
1. Generate a new list of 30 Danish words for each of 5 Study Days that are not in the W2 column already. 
3. For each word, create:
   - a natural, idiomatic Danish sentence at B2 level in spoken style inspired by my context: blues guitar, improvisation, retired life, carnivore diet, exercise, daily-life usefulness. This is the L2 field
   - an English sentence translation of the word. This is the W1 field
   - an English sentence translation of the Danish sentence L1. This is the L1 field. L1 MUST be a translation of L2. It is useless otherwise.
   - a short Note about unusual grammar, idiomatic usage, or context
   - the IPA for the Danish word
4. Ensure **all fields are properly quoted if they contain commas**. For example:
   "Mit yndlingsmåltid er en tyk, velkrydret bøf"
5. Keep **column order exactly**: W2,W1,L1,L2,StudyDay,Note,IPA
6. Increment the StudyDay by 1 from the last StudyDay in the CSV.
7. Output the result as a **single CSV code-block ready to append** to my master file.
