I am appending my current cumulative Danish vocabulary CSV file. 
It uses the following columns and order: W2,W1,L1,L2,StudyDay,Note,IPA
- W2 = Danish word
- W1 = English word
- L1 = English sentence
- L2 = Danish sentence
- StudyDay = integer
- Note = idiomatic or grammatical notes
- IPA = IPA for Danish word
⚠️ Important Instructions:
1. Generate a new **7-day batch** (5 sentences per day = 35 words total). 
2. Use **only Danish words that do not appear in my CSV**. 
3. For each word, create:
   - a natural, idiomatic Danish sentence in spoken style inspired by my context: blues guitar, improvisation, retired life, carnivore diet, exercise, daily-life usefulness
   - an English sentence translation
   - a short Note about grammar, idiomatic usage, or context
   - IPA for the Danish word
4. Ensure **all fields are properly quoted if they contain commas**. For example:
   "Mit yndlingsmåltid er en tyk, velkrydret bøf"
5. Keep **column order exactly**: W2,W1,L1,L2,StudyDay,Note,IPA
6. Increment StudyDay from the last StudyDay in the CSV.
7. Output the result as a **single CSV code-block ready to append** to my master file.

Do not repeat any words from the attached CSV.  
Generate **fresh, unique words and sentences** each week.
